"""General purpose async tools.

This module provides general purpose async tools that can be used to simplify the
development of asyncio-based applications.

The module provides the following classes and functions:

- [cancel_and_await][frequenz.core.asyncio.cancel_and_await]: A function that cancels a
  task and waits for it to finish, handling `CancelledError` exceptions.
- [Service][frequenz.core.asyncio.Service]: An interface for services running in the
  background.
- [ServiceBase][frequenz.core.asyncio.ServiceBase]: A base class for implementing
  services running in the background.
- [TaskCreator][frequenz.core.asyncio.TaskCreator]: A protocol for creating tasks.

    Warning:
        As services manage [`asyncio.Task`][] objects, a reference to a running service
        must be held for as long as the service is expected to be running. Otherwise, its

    [`create_task()`][frequenz.core.asyncio.ServiceBase.create_task] method.

    service, then you need to also override the
