"""General purpose async tools.

This module provides general purpose async tools that can be used to simplify the
development of asyncio-based applications.

The module provides the following classes and functions:

- [cancel_and_await][frequenz.core.asyncio.cancel_and_await]: A function that cancels a
  task and waits for it to finish, handling `CancelledError` exceptions.
- [Service][frequenz.core.asyncio.Service]: An interface for services running in the
  background.
- [ServiceBase][frequenz.core.asyncio.ServiceBase]: A base class for implementing
  services running in the background.
- [TaskCreator][frequenz.core.asyncio.TaskCreator]: A protocol for creating tasks.
