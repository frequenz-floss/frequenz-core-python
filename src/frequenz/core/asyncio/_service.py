    A service swpawns one of more background tasks and can be
    [started][frequenz.core.asyncio.Service.start] and
    [stopped][frequenz.core.asyncio.Service.stop] and can work as an async context
    manager to provide deterministic cleanup.

    Warning:
        As services manage [`asyncio.Task`][] objects, a reference to a running service
        must be held for as long as the service is expected to be running. Otherwise, its
        tasks will be cancelled and the service will stop. For more information, please
        refer to the [Python `asyncio`
        documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.create_task).

    Example:
        ```python
        async def as_context_manager(service: Service) -> None:
            async with service:

class ServiceBase(Service, abc.ABC):
    """A base class for implementing a service running in the background.

    To implement a service, subclasses must implement the
    [`start()`][frequenz.core.asyncio.ServiceBase.start] method, which should start the
    background tasks needed by the service using the
    [`create_task()`][frequenz.core.asyncio.ServiceBase.create_task] method.

    If you need to collect results or handle exceptions of the tasks when stopping the
    service, then you need to also override the
    [`stop()`][frequenz.core.asyncio.ServiceBase.stop] method, as the base
    implementation does not collect any results and re-raises all exceptions.
